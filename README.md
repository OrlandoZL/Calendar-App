# Calendar-App

## Description

Made a schedule planner so that time managing your day can be easy and organized. I worked on this to make time managment easier. It solves having to know when you have things to do and whether it is upcoming, it passed, or whether you should be on it right now. I learned how to work with moment.js and jquery. Making the loop for the current hour was challenging.
